# php_components
PHP 7.0 or above!

Different php scripts to speed up your programming time.

With this I'm trying to let inexperienced scripters or people tired of writing the same login script over and over again, to have simple functions for logging in. By this I hope you'll be able to spend less time on writing your own script, unless it is needed, and more time on your custom required methods / functions.
